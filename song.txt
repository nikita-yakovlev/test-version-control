1. Watch as the room rocks
2. Mentally moonwalk
3. Mixed media slang
4. Banging in your boom box verbal violence
5. Lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility
You're killing me
